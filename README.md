ACSAHE is a program dedicated to creating Moment-Normal Interaction Diagrams for arbitrary structural concrete sections, based on the CIRSOC 201 regulations of the Argentine Republic.

It was developed by Facundo L. Pfeffer in collaboration with Dr. Ing. Oscar Möller at the Institute of Applied Mechanics and Structures (IMAE) of the National University of Rosario.
